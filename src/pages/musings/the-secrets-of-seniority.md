Climbing the title ladder as a developer and engineer is a long hard road. When most people think about leveling up and growing their career, the focus is solely on technical skill sets and abilities. One thinks of technical competency, speed, experience, etc. While these are without a doubt valid and highly important areas of focus, I am here to highlight some lesser known and talked about skillsets and approaches that I wish someone had revealed to me earlier in my career.

### Leadership

Lead teams by example, don't try and force it. Become a resource. Be vocal in meetings. Volunteer for things other's on the team don't want to do. Assess what is the most valuable role you can play for your teams success and own it. 

### Communication

Understand your audience. Over vocalization is not a bad thing. Client and stakeholder communication is key. Use your manager and other resources. Extra emphasis when working remotely. Make sure everyone is linked in with what is happening. Be early to tell bad news, give everyone ample opportunity to think on things and react. Surprises are no fun.

### Impact

The most important of all other things I have mentioned. Don't like what you are using? Be the one that enables the transition to a better place. Saving $ or increasing production / stability are the most impactful you can be. Embrace the power of rapid prototypes. Reach out to other arms of your org/client to gather resources and help your push. Own your initiative and see it through.
