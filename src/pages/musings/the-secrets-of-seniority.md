Climbing the seniority tree as a developer and engineer is a long hard road. When most people think about leveling up and growing their career, the focus is solely on technical skill sets and abilities. One thinks of technical competency, speed, experience, etc. While these are without a doubt valid and highly important areas of focus, I am here to highlight some lesser talked about topics that I wish someone had revealed to me earlier in my career.

### Leadership

Leading a team is a very nuanced and delicate thing. Being a leader does not always mean taking control and driving the ship. In my experience, often good leaders are quick to take a back seat. To me, leadership is about being a great resource for your team and always acting with the success of everyone in mind. You must become a valued resource and consistently fill gaps. Be vocal in meetings, reach out to teammates often, volunteer for work others don't wish to do. Don't dominate, lead by example. I have had projects where I needed to manage the schedule and work for the entire team and I have had projects where I almost exclusively paired with teammates and help push features over the finish line. The bottom line is being a leader is implicit not explicit. A good leader will almost never have to state that they are so.

### Communication

Communication is a very deep and broad topic and I will almost assuredly not even scratch the surface with this post. The important aspects of communication that I wish to highlight break down into 3 categories:

* Breadth
* Context
* Timing

One of the greatest lessons I have learned in my career around communication is that the circle you communicate with **must** be larger than the circle you interact with on a day to day basis.Â While it may be important to make sure everyone on your team is linked up and on the same page, it is equally important that you are broadcasting outside your unit as well. Organizations, especially the larger ones, tend to create silos. In my experience, these organizational silos come up in almost every root cause analysis of mistakes and missteps. As a senior, you need to reach out to product stakeholders. You need to reach out to other development teams outside your domain and even your project. You need to reach out to marketing, sales, HR, etc. etc. Being the person to bridge the gap and gather resources and understanding is a huge factor in you and your teams success.

Which brings me to my second category, timing. This one is relatively simple and is best summed up by a quote my father has told me since I was young.

> If you are not early, you are late

You must be a leading indicator not a lagging one. If you notice something that may cause a blocker or deceleration down the road, communicate it to the appropriate resource as soon as you can. No one likes surprises. It is much easier to extinguish a spark and rather than an inferno. Giving others time to think, strategize, then act, as opposed to forcing a quick reaction, will always net better results for you and your team.

As a side note, it is also very important to have institutional knowledge of your org so that you can reach out to the appropriate parties. This is a whole other topic that I could go in depth on, but for now just know not to glaze over when it comes to your companies org chart. This also goes back to the breadth of your communication I mentioned above. Establish relationships outside your realm.

Lastly, focus on the context of your communication. Who is your audience and what is the nature of your message. This is the most often looked over aspect of good communication in my opinion. Try and step out of your shoes and understand the perspective and role of the party you are speaking with. If you are communicating with a project stakeholder or project manager, chances are the nuances of a technical decision or issue is not the messaging that will effectively give them understanding of your situation. Speak in terms that make sense to their priorities and roles. Tell them "X is affecting our ability to Y and in turn is slowing our velocity. We would like to see a change Z." Messaging that is concise, direct, and scoped to the listeners experience will not only save others time and be appreciated, but it will also lead to quantifiable actions and results.

### Impact

Leadership and communication are paramount to growing into a more senior developer, but impact is the hard ceiling. With the other two, you can be a great employee but never go anywhere. In order to bust through the ceiling, you must champion change that affects your organizations bottom line. This seems easy to point out, but how you champion those efforts are hugely important. You must gather resources and consensus from all parts of your organization (see communication). You must come with a batteries included solution. Saying something should be this way and showing a tooling and feature complete example are wildly different. Highlight quantifiable wins, lay out a transition path, demo early and often to everyone that will give you the time. Own your initiative fully and see it through. Taking on efforts of these magnitudes will open doors into arenas you previously didn't have access to or knew existed. It will make you uncomfortable and push you to your limits of knowledge and skill. I argue that nothing will be more pivotal to your growth, both in your career and technical know-how, than efforts like these. These are the types of engineers that organizations dream of and there is no better way to get in the good graces of your organization and the industry at large.
