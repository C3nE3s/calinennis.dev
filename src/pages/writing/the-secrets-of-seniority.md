When most people think about levelling up and growing their career, the focus is solely on technical skill sets and abilities. One thinks of technical competency, speed, experience, etc. While these are without a doubt valid and highly important areas of focus, I am here to highlight some lesser talked about topics that I wish someone had revealed to me earlier in my career.

### Leadership

Leading a team is a very nuanced and delicate thing. Being a leader does not always mean taking control and driving the ship. In my experience, often good leaders are quick to take a back seat. To me, leadership is about being a great resource for your team and always acting with the success of everyone in mind. You must become a valued resource and consistently fill gaps. Be vocal in meetings, reach out to teammates often, volunteer for work others don't wish to do. Don't dominate, lead by example. I have had projects where I needed to manage the schedule and work for the entire team and I have had projects where I almost exclusively paired with teammates to help push features over the finish line. Being an effective leader is implicit not explicit.

### Communication

One of the greatest lessons I have learned in my career around communication is that the circle you communicate with **must** be larger than the circle you interact with on a day to day basis. While it may be important to make sure everyone on your team is linked up and on the same page, it is equally important that you are broadcasting outside your unit as well. Organizations, especially the larger ones, tend to create silos of work. In my experience, these organizational silos come up in almost every root cause analysis when big missteps occur. You can help to counter those tendencies by bridging the gaps in communication, gathering the resources needed to solve the problem, and sharing knowledge and understanding of the current happenings. You need to reach out to your product stakeholders. You need to reach out to other development teams outside your domain and even your project. You need to reach out to marketing, sales, HR, etc. etc.

You must also try to be early in your communications. You must be a leading indicator not a lagging one. If you notice something that may cause a blocker or deceleration down the road, communicate it to the appropriate resource as soon as you can. No one likes surprises. It is much easier to extinguish a spark than a blaze. Giving others time to think, strategize, and _then_ act is a much preferred outcome. Communicating at the last second and forcing knee-jerk external intervention will always net a worse outcome for your team, product, and customers.

As an addendum to my pervious point, it is also very important to have institutional knowledge of your organization so that you can reach out to the appropriate resources. If you are part of a medium to large organization, know not to dismiss the importance of your companies org chart. Establishing relationships outside your own domain will prove invaluable in your ability to be effective as an employee.

Lastly, be alert to the parties you are communicating with and focus your wording and context appropriately. Who is your audience? What outcome are you trying to achieve? This is the most often looked over aspect of good communication in my opinion. Try and step out of your shoes and understand the perspective and role of involved in the communiqué. If you are communicating with a project stakeholder or project manager, chances are the nuances of a deep technical issue will not be the messaging that will lead to understanding. Speak in terms that make sense to their priorities and roles. Tell them "X is affecting our ability to Y and in turn is slowing our velocity. We would like to see change Z." Messaging that is concise, direct, and scoped to the listeners experience will not only save others time and be appreciated, but it will also lead to quantifiable actions and results.

### Impact

Leadership and communication are paramount to growth, but impact is the hard ceiling. With the other two, you can be a great employee but it is unlikely you will receive accolades or growth opportunities at the rate you expect. In order to bust through the ceiling, you must champion change that positively impacts your organizations bottom line.

This seems easy to point out, but how you champion those efforts are hugely important. You must gather resources and consensus from all parts of your organization (see communication). You must come with a batteries included solution. Saying something should be different and showing off a solution prototype will illicit entirely different reactions and outcomes. Present your solutions in a direct and concise manner as well. Highlight the quantifiable wins, lay out a transition path, demo early and often to everyone that will give you the time. Own your initiative fully and see it through.

Taking on efforts of these magnitudes will open doors into arenas you previously didn't know existed. It will make you uncomfortable and push you to your limits of knowledge and skill. I argue that nothing will be more pivotal to your growth, both in your career and technical know-how, than efforts like these. These are the types of engineers that organizations dream of and there is no better way to get in the good graces of your company and the industry at large.
