# Astro powered personal site ðŸš€

[Site](https://calinennis.dev)

## Stack

I am using Astro for its 0js default and its first class markdown support. Great usecase for a simple site and blog as well as a great DX (vite, partial hydration, write in any framework).

## Styling

- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [astro-icon](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon)

Previously

- [open-props](https://open-props.style)
- [radix-colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors)

Ended up doing a V2 of my site design and decided to switch from my custom properties approach to tailwind. The reasoning being speed of development, scale, and maintainability.

## Deploy

- Vercel
